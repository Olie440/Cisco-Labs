TODO:

- Create a new Topology from the template
- Setup a point to multipoint tunnel between the three routers to remind myself:
	- Paris:
		- set s0/0 encapsulation to frame-relay
		- bring up s0/0
		- create s0/0.1 with point to multipoint
		- set ip address on s0/0.1 to 192.168.123.1 255.255.255.0
		- turn off inverse ARP
		- map dlci 102 to 192.168.123.2
		- map dlci 103 to 192.168.123.3

	- Berlin:
		- set s0/0 encapsulation to frame-relay
		- bring up s0/0
		- create s0/0.1 with point to multipoint
		- set ip address on s0/0.1 to 192.168.123.2 255.255.255.0
		- turn off inverse ARP
		- map dlci 201 to 192.168.123.1

	- Stockholm:
		- set s0/0 encapsulation to frame-relay
		- bring up s0/0
		- create s0/0.1 with point to multipoint
		- set ip address on s0/0.1 to 192.168.123.3 255.255.255.0
		- turn off inverse ARP
		- map dlci 301 to 192.168.123.1

- Check the connection between the routers
- Set loopbacks on each of the routers:
	- Set Paris l0 to 1.1.1.1 /24
	- Set Berlin l0 to 2.2.2.2 /24
	- Set Stockholm l0 to 3.3.3.3 /24

- Set up OSPF on all routers:
	- Paris:
		- Create OSPF instance 1
		- Add network 1.1.1.0 area 0
		- Add network 192.168.123.0 area 0
		- Add neighbor 192.168.123.2
		- Add neighbor 192.168.123.3
		- Set OSPF network type to point to multipoint non broadcast on s0/0
		
	- Berlin:
		- Create OSPF instance 1
		- Add network 2.2.2.0 area 0
		- Add network 192.168.123.0 area 0
		- Set OSPF network type to point to multipoint non broadcast on s0/0
		- Set OSPF Priorty to 0

	- Stockholm:
		- Create OSPF instance 1
		- Add network 2.2.2.0 area 0
		- Add network 192.168.123.0 area 0
		- Set OSPF network type to point to multipoint non broadcast on s0/0
		- Set OSPF Priorty to 0
